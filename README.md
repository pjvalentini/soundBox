# soundBox App

This application is built in HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I am using two extra linraries with Paper.js and Howler.js.
(Please see documentation links below)

This app was built to learn how to work with both libraries and to learn to incorprate basic animations with sound,and, is similar to the Patatap application.  

Paper.js is imported as a file from the site, whereas I am using a CDN for the use of Howler.js

You may need to cofigure your code editor to be able to read paperscript as Paper.js uses this.  
Initially my VSCode text editor was not syntax hightlighting the paperscript code I wrote so I had to modify my VSCode configuration.

Please for to this link to see how to configure your editor for paperscript syntax highlighting on VSCode.

NOTE: Sublime 3 has a package for this so its much easier to fix this issue.
